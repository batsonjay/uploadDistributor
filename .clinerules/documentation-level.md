## Brief overview
This rule defines the appropriate level of detail for pseudo-code and implementation examples in planning and documentation files. The goal is to maintain concise, conceptual documentation that communicates intent without overwhelming with implementation details.

## Pseudo-code in planning documents
- Include only enough code to demonstrate the concept or approach
- Focus on the core logic and data flow rather than complete implementations
- Omit detailed styling definitions (e.g., CSS classes) unless they're central to the discussion
- Use simplified syntax that communicates intent rather than exact implementation
- Highlight key functions, methods, or components that will be created
- Show critical interactions between components without exhaustive detail

## Implementation examples
- When providing implementation examples, focus on the most important parts
- Include only the code that directly relates to the concept being explained
- For UI components, focus on structure and functionality, not styling details
- Omit boilerplate code that doesn't add value to understanding the concept
- Use comments to indicate where additional standard code would exist

## Documentation structure
- Separate conceptual explanations from implementation details
- Use clear section headings to organize different aspects of the plan
- Summarize complex implementations rather than detailing every step
- For multi-phase implementations, focus on the high-level approach for future phases

## Code snippets
- Keep code snippets focused on demonstrating a single concept
- Prefer shorter, more targeted examples over comprehensive implementations
- Use ellipses (...) to indicate omitted standard or boilerplate code
- Include comments to explain the purpose of key sections
