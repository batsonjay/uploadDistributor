## Brief overview
This rule defines how to manage the active context file to keep it focused and concise. The active context file should only contain information necessary for the current task, avoiding unnecessary growth and accumulation of historical information.

## Active context management
- Keep the active context file slim and focused only on the current task
- Include only information that is necessary for "right now" and any prerequisite information required to complete the current task
- Avoid letting the file grow unchecked with historical information
- When a task is completed, update the active context to summarize only the most recently completed step and describe the next step to be taken
- Move detailed historical information to appropriate project documentation (e.g., Implementation Plan) rather than keeping it in the active context

## Documentation strategy
- Use project documentation files (like Implementation-plan.md) for tracking overall progress and historical information
- When completing a task, update relevant project documentation with details about what was accomplished
- After updating project documentation, slim down the active context file to focus only on the current/next task

## Context transitions
- When transitioning between tasks, ensure the active context file is updated to reflect only what's needed for the new task
- Remove information that is no longer relevant to the current focus
- Summarize completed work briefly rather than maintaining detailed descriptions

## Communication style
- When discussing the active context, be explicit about what information should be retained versus what should be moved to project documentation
- Provide clear summaries of completed work and next steps in the active context file
