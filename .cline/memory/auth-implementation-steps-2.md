# Authentication Implementation Steps - Part 2 (Temporary Document)

**NOTE: This is a temporary document that should be removed after implementation is complete.**

## Testing Strategy Note

**First Testing Point: After Step 3 (Creating Authentication Routes)**
- After completing Step 3 in this document, we'll have a functional authentication system with API endpoints
- We'll test the authentication routes to verify login, token validation, and profile retrieval
- This allows us to catch any issues with the authentication system before proceeding with the integration

## Implementation Steps (Continued)

### Step 3: Create Authentication Routes (COMPLETED)

Created the auth.ts file in the routes directory with:
- Login route that accepts email and password
- Token validation route to verify authentication tokens
- Profile route to retrieve user information
- Error handling for all routes
- Updated the main index.ts file to use these routes

### Step 4: Update SonglistStorage for User Roles (COMPLETED)

Updated the SonglistStorage.ts file to:
- Import user role types from AuthService
- Extend the SonglistData interface to include user_role and destinations fields
- Update the parseSonglist function to handle the new fields with default values

### Step 5: Update Upload Processor for Role-Based Flows (COMPLETED)

Updated the upload-processor.ts file to:
- Get user role from metadata or songlist
- Implement different processing flows for DJ and Admin users
- Return success immediately for DJ users after storing the songlist
- Continue processing in the background for DJ users
- Only update final status for Admin users
- Respect selected destinations from the songlist
- Upload to selected platforms sequentially with platform-specific recovery logic
