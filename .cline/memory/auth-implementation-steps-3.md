# Authentication Implementation Steps - Part 3 (Temporary Document)

**NOTE: This is a temporary document that should be removed after implementation is complete.**

## Progress Update (May 5, 2025)

### Completed Steps:
- Step 6: Implemented Timezone Conversion
  - Created TimezoneUtils.ts with functions for converting between UTC and CET/CEST
  - Updated upload-processor.ts to use these conversions for metadata

- Step 7: Implemented Two-Tier Logging System
  - Created LoggingUtils.ts with functions for logging destination status and errors
  - Updated upload-processor.ts to use the logging utilities

- Fixed SoundCloudApiMock.ts to properly implement the two-step upload process API
  - Added uploadFile method for Step 1 (file upload)
  - Added updateTrackMetadata method for Step 2 (metadata update)
  - Added additional helper methods (getTrackInfo, updateTrackInfo)

- Step 8: Refactored upload-processor.ts (file exceeded 500-line guideline)
  - Created services directory with destination-specific upload services:
    - AzuraCastService.ts
    - MixcloudService.ts
    - SoundCloudService.ts
  - Created StatusManager.ts for status updates and logging
  - Made the main upload-processor.ts file more concise by delegating to service classes

- Step 9: Updated SoundCloudService to use two-step process
  - Implemented the two-step upload process using the updated SoundCloudApiMock
  - First uploads the file, then updates the metadata in a separate step
  - Added error handling and recovery logic

- Step 11: Fixed StatusManager Path Resolution
  - Fixed the StatusManager.ts path resolution to correctly handle both ts-node and compiled JavaScript environments
  - Implemented a more robust path detection system that works in both development and production
  - Added logging to show which uploads directory is being used
  - Added a small delay before exiting the upload processor to ensure status files are fully written
  - Enhanced the test script to properly test the complete upload flow

### Next Steps:
- All authentication implementation steps are now complete
- The next phase would be to integrate the authentication system with the real AzuraCast API
- This would involve updating the AuthService to use the real API endpoints instead of mock data

## Testing Strategy Note

**Second Testing Point: After Step 5 (Updating Upload Processor)**
- After completing Step 5 in the previous document, we'll have a fully integrated role-based authentication system
- We'll test the complete authentication and upload process
- We'll verify that different user roles (Admin vs DJ) follow the appropriate workflows
- This comprehensive test will ensure all components work together correctly

## Implementation Steps (Continued)

### Step 6: Implement Timezone Conversion (COMPLETED)

Created TimezoneUtils.ts with:
- utcToCet function to convert UTC timestamps to Central European Time
- cetToUtc function to convert CET/CEST timestamps to UTC
- Updated upload-processor.ts to use these conversions for destination metadata

### Step 7: Implement Two-Tier Logging System (COMPLETED)

Created LoggingUtils.ts with:
- Log types (SUCCESS, ERROR) and error types (AUTHENTICATION, VALIDATION, etc.)
- logDestinationStatus function for high-level success/error logging
- logDetailedError function for detailed error information
- Configured log file paths and ensured log directory exists

### Step 8: Refactor upload-processor.ts (COMPLETED)

Created StatusManager service:
- Handles status updates and logging for upload processes
- Provides a centralized way to update status files and log events
- Includes methods for updating status, logging success, and logging errors

Created destination-specific services:
- AzuraCastService.ts for AzuraCast uploads
- MixcloudService.ts for Mixcloud uploads
- SoundCloudService.ts for SoundCloud uploads
- Each service handles platform-specific upload logic and error recovery

### Step 9: Update SoundCloudService to use two-step process (COMPLETED)

Implemented the two-step upload process in SoundCloudService:
- Step 1: Upload the file with initial metadata
- Step 2: Update the metadata after successful upload
- Added recovery logic for quota/permission issues
- Implemented fallback to private uploads when needed
- Added detailed logging for both steps

### Step 11: Fix StatusManager Path Resolution (COMPLETED)

Fixed the StatusManager.ts path resolution:
- Added robust path detection for both ts-node and compiled JavaScript environments
- Implemented directory structure detection to find the correct uploads directory
- Added logging to show which uploads directory is being used
- Added a delay before exiting to ensure status files are fully written
- Enhanced the test script with proper user role and delay handling

### Step 10: Implement Password Obfuscation with XOR (COMPLETED)

Implemented password obfuscation with XOR to avoid plaintext passwords:

1. Created PasswordUtils.ts with:
   - encodePassword function that uses XOR with a fixed key and base64 encoding
   - decodePassword function that reverses the process
   - Proper error handling for edge cases

2. Updated AuthService.ts to:
   - Accept encoded passwords instead of plaintext
   - Decode passwords before authentication
   - Update method signatures for authenticateWithAzuraCast

3. Updated auth.ts routes to:
   - Accept both encoded and plaintext passwords for backward compatibility
   - Encode plaintext passwords on the server side if needed
   - Update error messages and validation

4. Updated AzuraCastApiMock.ts to:
   - Support encoded passwords in authenticateWithCredentials
   - Handle both password formats for backward compatibility
   - Properly record authentication requests with redacted passwords

5. Created test-password-utils.ts to verify:
   - Encoding and decoding works for various password types
   - The login flow works correctly with encoded passwords
   - All tests pass successfully
