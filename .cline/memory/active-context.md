# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Integrated songlist parser into daemon with dedicated API endpoint
- Created SonglistParserService wrapper for the parser functionality
- Added parse-songlist endpoint with GET and POST routes
- Implemented worker thread for background processing
- Updated file handling with normalized filenames from metadata
- Simplified archive directory structure for better organization
- Improved file cleanup to properly remove temporary directories
- Created a test-parse page for testing the parser integration

## Current Task
- Enhance the main upload flow (/upload) to use the new parse-songlist endpoint
- Update the upload process to leverage the daemon's integrated songlist parser
- Ensure proper handling of parsed results in the validation flow
- Maintain title/artist order confirmation functionality

## Next Steps
- Mark the test-parse page as obsolete (it was only an interim step)
- Replace destination upload mocks with code to upload to the actual destinations
- Verify status updates and error handling
- Confirm archive file verification works correctly
