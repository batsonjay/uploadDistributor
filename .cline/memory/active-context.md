# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Fixed ESM module issues with ts-node in the daemon
- Implemented standardized logging system across all parsers
- Fixed file extension handling in file-processor.ts to properly detect all supported file types
- Added React StrictMode protection to prevent duplicate form submissions
- Created comprehensive debugging notes for ESM module issues with ts-node
- Removed temporary test files used for debugging

## Current Task
- Prepare for commit of the fixes and improvements
- Update documentation to reflect the current state of the project
- Ensure all parsers are working correctly with the new logging system

## Next Steps
- Complete Phase 7 of the Songlist Parsing Implementation Plan:
  - Extend LoggingUtils with additional parser-specific functions if needed
  - Implement environment-based logging control
  - Prepare logging infrastructure for destination uploads
- Enhance the main upload flow (/upload) to use the new parse-songlist endpoint
- Update the upload process to leverage the daemon's integrated songlist parser
- Ensure proper handling of parsed results in the validation flow
- Maintain title/artist order confirmation functionality
- Mark the test-parse page as obsolete (it was only an interim step)
- Replace destination upload mocks with code to upload to the actual destinations
