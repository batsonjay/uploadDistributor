# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Implemented Role-Based Access Control
  - Created roleVerification middleware with verifyRole, adminOnly, and anyAuthenticated functions
  - Protected upload and status routes with role verification
  - Added user information to request object for use in route handlers
  - Created comprehensive test script to verify role-based access control

## Current Task
- The role-based access control implementation is complete
- The authentication system now protects routes based on user roles
- The upload and status routes require authentication
- All tests for role verification pass successfully

## Next Step
- All authentication implementation steps are now complete
- The next phase would be to integrate the authentication system with the real AzuraCast API
- This would involve updating the AuthService to use the real API endpoints instead of mock data
