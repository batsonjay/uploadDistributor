## Most Recently Completed Step
- Enhanced upload processor to use sequential uploads with platform-specific recovery logic:
  - Changed from parallel uploads to sequential processing
  - Implemented platform-specific retry mechanisms
  - Added detailed status reporting for each platform
  - Improved error handling and isolation
- Enhanced songlist metadata structure for better platform support:
  - Added new fields to the songlist schema (genre, tags, artwork, description)
  - Created platform-specific metadata sections
  - Added support for Mixcloud and SoundCloud specific requirements
  - Defined an approved list of genres based on Mixcloud charts
- Updated documentation to reflect enhanced metadata requirements:
