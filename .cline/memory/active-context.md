# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Updated auth-implementation.md to document the middleware changes needed to align with localStorage-based authentication
- Added detailed pseudo-code examples for:
  - Attaching tokens from localStorage to requests using Authorization headers
  - Updating middleware.ts to check for Authorization headers instead of cookies
  - Creating a fetch wrapper that automatically attaches tokens to API requests
  - Options for handling page navigation and initial page loads

## Current Task
- Fix the authentication flow issue where the middleware is checking for cookies but the AuthContext is using localStorage
- Implement the middleware changes as documented in auth-implementation.md

## Next Steps
- Update middleware.ts to check for Authorization headers instead of cookies
- Modify AuthContext.tsx to attach the token to all requests
- Implement a solution for ensuring the token is available during page navigation
- Test the authentication flow end-to-end to ensure it works correctly
- Verify that the role-based token expiration still functions as expected
