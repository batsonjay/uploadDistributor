# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Renamed the "uploads" directory to "received-files" to be consistent with the new terminology
- Updated all code references to the directory in:
  - receive.ts
  - status.ts
  - StatusManager.ts
  - upload-processor.ts
- Changed the environment variable from UPLOAD_DIR to RECEIVED_FILES_DIR
- Migrated existing files from the old "uploads" directory to the new "received-files" directory

## Current Task
- All terminology changes are now complete and fully tested
- Both the daemon and shared module now use consistent terminology
- No backward compatibility code remains
- Directory names now match the new terminology
- All environment variables have been updated to reflect the new terminology

## Next Steps
- Consider updating the processor name from `upload-processor.ts` to `file-processor.ts` in a future update
- Update any documentation that might still reference the old terminology
