# Active Context: TypeScript Config Fixes

## Task Summary
Fix TypeScript configuration errors in the monorepo caused by unresolved package path references in `tsconfig.json` files.

## Work Completed
- Updated `packages/daemon/tsconfig.json`:
  - Changed `extends` from `@uploadDistributor/typescript-config/daemon.json` to `../typescript-config/daemon.json`
- Updated `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`:
  - Changed `extends` from `@uploadDistributor/typescript-config/base.json` to `../typescript-config/base.json`
- Verified that the referenced config files exist and are valid
- Confirmed that the package `@uploadDistributor/typescript-config` is defined and listed as a dependency
- Attempted to run `tsc --noEmit` to verify the fix, but output was inconclusive due to terminal spinner

## Work Remaining
- Re-run `tsc --noEmit` in both `packages/daemon` and `packages/shared` to confirm that the TypeScript errors are resolved
- If errors persist, investigate further (e.g., check for stale cache, restart TS server, or inspect other config references)

## Status
Work in progress â€” file changes made, verification pending.

I was working on fixing TypeScript configuration errors in the project. Specifically, I changed package path references to relative path references in both `packages/daemon/tsconfig.json` and `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`. The changes were made, but we haven't been able to fully verify if the errors are resolved due to interruptions during the TypeScript compilation tests. The last step I was attempting was to run TypeScript checks on both packages to confirm the fixes were successful. The task is incomplete as we haven't confirmed that the TypeScript errors are fully resolved, though the necessary file changes have been made.
