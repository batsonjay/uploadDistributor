# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Implemented Step 1 of the terminology changes to clarify the distinction between:
  1. Client/tests **sending** files TO the daemon (daemon **receiving** files)
  2. Daemon **uploading** files TO endpoints (AzuraCast, Mixcloud, SoundCloud)
- Changes included:
  - Renamed `packages/daemon/src/routes/upload.ts` to `packages/daemon/src/routes/receive.ts`
  - Updated `packages/daemon/src/index.ts` to reference the new route file
  - Updated `packages/daemon/src/processors/upload-processor.ts` to clarify "receiving" vs "uploading" terminology
  - Updated `packages/daemon/src/services/StatusManager.ts` to use consistent terminology
  - Kept the actual API endpoint as `/upload` for now to minimize changes
  - Verified the changes work correctly by running the daemon and tests

## Current Task
- Continuing with the terminology changes to clarify the distinction between sending/receiving and uploading
- Step 2 of the plan involves updating the shared module, test files, and documentation

## Next Step
- Implement Step 2 of the terminology changes:
  - Rename `packages/shared/src/upload.ts` to `packages/shared/src/send.ts`
  - Rename test files and update their content
  - Update documentation to use consistent terminology
  - Test the changes to ensure everything works correctly
