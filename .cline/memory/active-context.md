# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Implemented Step 2 of the terminology changes to clarify the distinction between:
  1. Client/tests **sending** files TO the daemon (daemon **receiving** files)
  2. Daemon **uploading** files TO endpoints (AzuraCast, Mixcloud, SoundCloud)
- Changes included:
  - Created `packages/shared/src/send.ts` with updated terminology
  - Updated `packages/shared/src/index.ts` to export from the new file
  - Created `packages/daemon/__tests__/send-with-shared.test.ts` with updated terminology
  - Added a new test script to package.json: `test-send-shared`
  - Updated documentation in `docs/daemon-apis.md` and `docs/Implementation-plan.md`
  - Added backward compatibility exports in send.ts to maintain compatibility with existing code
  - Kept the original upload.ts file for now to avoid breaking existing code

## Current Task
- Completed the terminology changes to clarify the distinction between sending/receiving and uploading
- Both Step 1 (daemon changes) and Step 2 (shared module and documentation changes) are now complete

## Next Steps
- Test the changes to ensure everything works correctly:
  1. Run the daemon with `npm run dev`
  2. Run the new test with `npm run test-send-shared`
- Consider additional documentation updates if needed
- Consider renaming the upload directory to "files" or "received" in a future update
