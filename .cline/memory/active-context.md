# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Fixed role detection in AuthService and improved directory verification
  - Updated the mapAzuraCastRoleToUserRole method to properly handle complex role objects
  - Changed the parameter type from `string[]` to `any[]` to accommodate the actual data structure
  - Implemented proper detection of role names using `role.name` instead of assuming string values
  - Added detailed logging to show the roles received from AzuraCast
  - Simplified the test-directory-verification.ts to focus on the key test cases

## Current Task
- The directory verification implementation is now working correctly
- The authentication system properly handles the complex role objects from AzuraCast
- The test-directory-verification.ts file has been simplified to focus on the key test cases
- All tests for directory verification pass successfully

## Next Step
- Complete the integration with the real AzuraCast API for file uploads
- Begin replacing other mocks with actual API integrations
- Start work on Web Client Development with role-based UI
