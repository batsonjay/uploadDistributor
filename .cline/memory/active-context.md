# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Renamed the processor from `upload-processor.ts` to `file-processor.ts` to be consistent with the new terminology
- Updated the function name from `processUpload()` to `processFiles()`
- Updated references to the processor in receive.ts
- Added a new script to package.json: `process-file` for running the processor directly

## Current Task
- All terminology changes are now complete and fully tested
- Both the daemon and shared module now use consistent terminology
- No backward compatibility code remains
- Directory names now match the new terminology
- All environment variables have been updated to reflect the new terminology
- Processor name has been updated to reflect the new terminology
- Old processor file can be safely deleted

## Next Steps
- Update any documentation that might still reference the old terminology
