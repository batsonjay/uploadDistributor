# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Added M3U8 parser to support M3U8 playlist format
- Integrated M3U8 parser with the daemon's songlist parsing system
- Updated parse-songlist endpoint to handle M3U8 files
- Verified successful parsing of M3U8 files through the daemon
- Created comprehensive documentation for the parser implementation
- Updated existing documentation to reflect M3U8 support

## Current Task
- Clean up temporary test files
- Prepare for commit of M3U8 parser implementation
- Document TODOs for future improvements:
  1. Investigate songlist storage location consistency
  2. Unify execution end for all song file types

## Next Steps
- Enhance the main upload flow (/upload) to use the new parse-songlist endpoint
- Update the upload process to leverage the daemon's integrated songlist parser
- Ensure proper handling of parsed results in the validation flow
- Maintain title/artist order confirmation functionality
- Mark the test-parse page as obsolete (it was only an interim step)
- Replace destination upload mocks with code to upload to the actual destinations
