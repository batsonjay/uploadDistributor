# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Updated project documentation to implement role-based architecture:
  - Created new shared-client-requirements.md document for common client requirements
  - Updated destination-apis.md with role-specific error handling and timezone considerations
  - Updated Implementation-plan.md to reflect role-based architecture changes
  - Added user role (DJ vs Admin) distinction throughout the system
