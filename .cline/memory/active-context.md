# Active Context: Upload Distributor Project

## Most Recently Completed Step
- Implemented Password Obfuscation with XOR (Step 10)
  - Created PasswordUtils.ts with functions for encoding/decoding passwords
  - Updated AuthService to use password obfuscation
  - Updated auth routes to handle encoded passwords
  - Updated AzuraCastApiMock to support encoded passwords
  - Created and ran test script to verify password obfuscation works correctly

## Current Task
- The password obfuscation implementation is complete
- The authentication system now uses XOR-based password obfuscation to avoid plaintext passwords
- The login route supports both encoded and non-encoded passwords for backward compatibility
- All tests for password obfuscation pass successfully

## Next Step
- All authentication implementation steps are now complete
- The next phase would be to integrate the authentication system with the real AzuraCast API
- This would involve updating the AuthService to use the real API endpoints instead of mock data
