# Authentication Implementation Steps - Part 1 (Temporary Document)

**NOTE: This is a temporary document that should be removed after implementation is complete.**

## User Information

- Admin User:
  - Email: batsonjay@mac.com
  - Display Name: catalyst
  - Role: Super Administrator

- DJ User:
  - Email: miker@mrobs.co.uk
  - Display Name: Chewee
  - Role: DJ

## Testing Strategy

The implementation will be tested at two key points:

1. **First Testing Point: After Step 3 (Creating Authentication Routes)**
   - At this point, we'll have a functional authentication system with API endpoints
   - We can test user login, token validation, and profile retrieval
   - This allows us to verify the authentication system before integrating it with the upload process

2. **Second Testing Point: After Step 5 (Updating Upload Processor)**
   - This is when the role-based flow will be fully integrated
   - We can test the complete authentication and upload process
   - We'll verify that different user roles (Admin vs DJ) follow the appropriate workflows

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create AuthService Module (COMPLETED)

Created the AuthService.ts file with:
- User role constants (ADMIN, DJ)
- User profile and authentication response interfaces
- Mock user data for testing
- Authentication methods for login and token validation
- Placeholder methods for future AzuraCast API integration

### Step 2: Enhance AzuraCastApiMock (COMPLETED)

Updated AzuraCastApiMock.ts to:
- Use the AuthService for authentication
- Add methods for user authentication, token validation, and profile retrieval
- Record authentication-related API requests for testing and debugging
